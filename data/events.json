The intention of the event is to transform the Sun Salutation from a warm-up into a powerful sequence of movements, unique to your own individual practice and body, which perfectly encapsulates the beauty of the practice of Yoga as a whole.

Jamie will then introduce and explain the transformational ‘Ujjayi Breath’ and use of Bhandas, leading students through exercises to practice and understand these more subtle actions. Following this, we will explore the integral practice of synchronizing the breath with each movement, with tips and tricks provided as to how to do this in the most efficient and powerful way possible. The event will conclude with Jamie leading students through 5 x Surya Namaskar A’s and 5 x Surya Namaskar B’s so participants can put into practice and assimilate all of the knowledge acquired.",
